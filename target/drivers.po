"The JPIPKAK driver uses an approach that was first demonstrated here, "
"`J2KViewer <http://www.drc-dev.ohiolink.edu/browser/J2KViewer>`__, by "
"Juan Pablo Garcia Ortiz of separating the communication layer (socket / "
"http) from the Kakadu kdu_cache object. Separating the communication "
"layer from the data object is desirable since it allows the use of "
"optimized http client libraries such as libcurl, Apache HttpClient (note "
"that jportiz used a plain Java socket) and allows SSL communication "
"between the client and server."
