"OGR used to stand for OpenGIS Simple Features Reference Implementation. "
"However, since OGR is not fully compliant with the OpenGIS Simple Feature"
" specification and is not approved as a reference implementation of the "
"spec the name was changed to OGR Simple Features Library. The only "
"meaning of OGR in this name is historical. OGR is also the prefix used "
"everywhere in the source of the library for class names, filenames, etc."
